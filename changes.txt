We have working version on main 2023/10/31, but probably needs 
ifferent handling of X0 and Y0, maybe t0 too.

Let's start with fixing a few obvious things

 -✓- Yaml files should have no redundant info 
 -✓- corner plots need to be smaller and larger labels
 -✓- switches should not be negative
 
 - made time scalng changeable through constants
 - read back samples for corner plots
 - cleaned up corner plots
 
 
 Picking up in Feb 2024. 
 - I think the non-redundant code was implmented
 
 - Did some benchmarking and tried AI improvements
 	- Improved run time by factor 6, by storing planet/earth ephemeris outside loops
 	- note that M3 macbook is about factor 3 faster
 	
 - Need a simulated data set that converges
 - Need to write some software/code version in output
 Did that refv is the new standard

Did a lot of work in early 2025
- Changed all model interfaces to allow for 2 stars
