We have working version on main 2023/10/31, but probably needs different handling of X0 and Y0, maybe t0 too.

Let's start with fixing a few obvious things

 -✓- Yaml files should have no redundant info 
 -✓- corner plots need to be smaller and larger labels
 -✓- switches should not be negative
 
 - made time scalng changeable through constants
 - read back samples for corner plots
 - cleaned up corner plots
